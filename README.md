=======
It is a projecto help to my comunity, given to the people of my town an app as a tool to monitorate the advance of the transit during the mantainance of the streests.

The idea are two apps conected to firebase, the first app raise a flag indicating on wich direction the traffic is flowing in the principal street, this way is under repair, the second app gives to the user the posibility to see on wich direction is the traffic flowing and what's the time period. It may help the people to coordinate their time, in the future we hope to add some map funtionality track how it is flowing visually too.

I'm usiing Flutter/Firebase on this project using Bloc for the statemanagement and the mvvm pattern.
